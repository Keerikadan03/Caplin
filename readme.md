<h1>Program Overview</h1>
<p>This program is designed to download a webpage from https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/29364/pg29364.txt, convert it to lowercase, and count the frequency of each letter that starts a word. It will then output the letter that begins the most words on the page.</p>

<h1>Design Decisions</h1>
<p>There were some decisions that I needed to make regarding how to interpret the requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The requirements did not specify how to handle non-letter characters that start words, such as underscores or brackets. To keep it simple, I decided to include them in the count and treat them as letters.</li>

<li>Another decision was to treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same, to simplify the counting process.</li>

<li>I considered using a more advanced natural language processing library to tokenize the text and extract the first letter of each word, but ultimately opted for a simpler approach.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>In order to run this program, you'll need to have Java version 8 or higher installed on your computer.</p>

<h1>Running the Program</h1>

<p>To run the program, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt or terminal window.</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory containing the program file, MostFrequentLetter.java.</li>
<li>Compile the program by entering the command javac MostFrequentLetter.java.</li>
<li>Run the program by entering the command java MostFrequentLetter.</li>
<li>The program will download the webpage and output the letter that starts the most words.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Overall, this program provides a straightforward and efficient method for counting the frequency of letters that start words on a webpage. While there are certainly more advanced techniques that could be used for natural language processing, this simple approach should suffice for most purposes.</p>
